### Instructions on how to contribute.

(Assuming that u already have cloned the repo and are inside the repo directory)

1. Make sure you are on the **main** branch.

`git checkout main`

2. Get all the new changes of the **main** branch, in case anyone else made changes.

`git pull`

3. Create a new branch for the feature you are going to work on.

`git checkout -b feature-name`

4. Once you are done developing, add and commit your changes locally. You can also use VSCode's built-in Git support to do this.

`git add .`

`git commit -m "A descriptive commit message"`

5. Now, push your feature branch to remote. After this, you will be able to see your branch in the repository online.

`git push origin branch-name`
